## What i've learned


Deveolping this project i had a chance to improve my JS skills and learn how to implement external frameworks or tools. 
More in depth i've implemented JQuery to "switching pages" with event handler and css classes.

Later i made an extensive use of css to provide a better user experience enhacing the user interface, and made it responsive.

Finally I implemented Webpack to deploy the entire app, learning how Webpack works and how to implement loaders and plugins.
